I struggle with acne and this is the only product thats keeps my face acne free. Every time I’ve stopped using it, I have regretted it. It works so fast. I love what it does for my darks spots as-well. Honestly if you can’t afford to use all of the Glytone products this is the only one you truly need. When I can afford to buy the others I do, but this is the one I cannot live without.\n\n**Great product**\n\nI have used this product consistently for a couple of years, as suggested by my dermatologist. I have found it to be exactly what it claims to be...that improves fine lines and wrinkles. It is also easy to apply.\n\n**This works!**\n\nI’ve been using the eye cream for over a year. It goes on easy and absorbs quickly. It has whitened my dark circles and has helped my crows feet look better.\n\nThis stuff is the holy grail for sensitive skin. It is effective yet doesn’t over dry.\n\n**Rejuve lotion 20**\n\nPlease please bring this back to us!!!! I call and get the same answer all the time!! That your not discontinuing but don't know when it will be back!! Its so heartbreaking & frustrating we can't get a real answer ??????\n\n**I love this product!**\n\nMy skin is smooth after just a few weeks. I use it 2-3 times a week, which has been working well so far.\n\n**Great product**\n\nI have been using this product for several years and it is part of my daily regime to keep my skin as healthy as possible. I will use it forever.\n\n**Life Saver!**\n\nThis is the only thing that works for my rosacea and combination skin.\n\n**BRING IT BACK**\n\nPLEASE RESTOCK THE PRODUCT! What is going on? its been out of stock for months! Can you give your customers some transparency please - are they being discontinued? reformulated? are you having supply chain issues? Please let us know.\n\n**Serum**\n\nI love Glytone and the #17 Exfoliating Serum. I can feel it working as soon as I put it on. I wish they still made the cleansing pads!\n\n**LOVE THIS LOTION**\n\nPlease, please bring this back. I have been using it for years and absolutely love this formula. Again, PLEASE BRING THIS PRODUCT BACK.\n\n**Mini Peel Gel**\n\nI received a sample with a previous order and used it about once a week until gone. Now I have a full container of it. It’s easy to use and for the brief time its on is easy to forget. It’s light and leaves skin feeling refreshed. For many years Glytone products have been my daily routine. People remark about how my skin reflects my health which of course makes me happy.\n\n**Just Wow! Even on sensitive skin.**\n\nAs a consumer of brands to include; La Mer, Sisley, and Natura Bisse I am more than impressed, and very pleased with this product. I achieved better results after 2 applications of this peel than any other of the above brands. My skin can be sensitive to peels and most “turnover” products in home or at Spa can burn or irritate with no real visible results. This left my skin dewy and bright. Don’t be fooled. It does the job as my friends with normal skin tried it as well and loved it! It’s now clear why it was back ordered so long. So glad I took a chance. Couldn’t be happier! Best results ever! Thank you.\n\n**Do not like texture**\n\nI have used this product before and l liked it. However, the texture of the product has changed or was frozen en route. It is very thick, will not mix, and will not come out through the pumper. I have to take the pumper off, turn it upside down, and hit it on the counter to dispense. Will probably not purchase again\n\nI actually use this on scalp  \nas a a exfoliant\n\nLove it\n\nLong time user  \nGreat products  \nHonest company\n\n**Best night cream**\n\nI love this cream. I love the texture and how it feels on my face. Second jar ordered\n\nThis cleanser works very well for my dry skin, especially in the winter season.\n\n**I miss this!**\n\nPlease bring it back. My dermatologist recommended it years ago & I miss it. It helped exfoliate dead skin from my retinol.\n\n**A amazing product**\n\nThis is a unique amazing actually fun di use product this isn't my first rodeo with this product I love how different acid combination alongside other select ingredients work to lighten brighten and smooth complexion I highly highly recommend and use this product thank you glytone for fast tangible results"
