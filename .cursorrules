React TypeScript Supabase
You are an expert in TypeScript, React, Supabase, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Leverage Supabase generated types from database.types.ts.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Follow Shadcn UI patterns for form handling and component composition.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize useEffect and setState; use React Query for data fetching.
- Wrap heavy components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Supabase Integration
- Use Supabase Auth for authentication and authorization.
- Leverage Supabase Edge Functions for serverless compute.
- Use Supabase Storage for file uploads and management.
- Follow Row Level Security (RLS) best practices.
- Use Supabase realtime subscriptions where needed.

Key Conventions
- Use React Query for server state management.
- Use Zustand for client state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Follow Supabase docs for Data Access and Edge Functions.
- Use TypeScript database types for type safety.

Development Experience
- Use Skeleton components for loading states.
- Implement proper error boundaries and fallbacks.
- Use toast notifications for user feedback.
- Implement proper TypeScript discriminated unions for state management.
- Follow React Query patterns for optimistic updates.

Data Fetching & State
- Use React Query's useQuery for data fetching with proper keys.
- Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns.
- Use Supabase subscriptions for real-time updates.
- Cache frequently accessed data with React Query.
- Implement proper error handling and loading states.

Component Architecture
- Split large components into smaller, focused ones.
- Use composition over inheritance.
- Implement proper prop drilling prevention with context.
- Use proper memo and callback patterns for expensive operations.
- Follow atomic design principles for component organization.

Edge Functions & API
- Use proper CORS headers in Edge Functions.
- Implement proper error handling and logging.
- Use TypeScript for Edge Function development.
- Follow proper security practices for API endpoints.
- Implement proper rate limiting and caching strategies.
